// I started by creating a function that calculates monthly mortgage payment
function calculateMortgage(loanAmount, annualInterestRate, years) {       

// I converted the annual interest rate to a monthly interest rate - 12 for months and 100 for decimal
    let monthlyInterestRate = annualInterestRate / 100 / 12;   

// I calculated the total number of months (which equals to the total number of payments)
    let numberOfPayments = years * 12;                                  

// I used the following formula found on the internet for calculating monthly payments
    let monthlyPayment = (loanAmount * monthlyInterestRate * Math.pow(1 + monthlyInterestRate, numberOfPayments)) /
                         (Math.pow(1 + monthlyInterestRate, numberOfPayments) - 1);

    return monthlyPayment;  // Monthly payment is returned
}

// Below I will use random data for a loan amount, annual interest rate, and years

let loanSum = 1000000;        // (EUR)
let interestRate = 5;     //  (%)
let loanPeriod = 30;                // (years)

// I calculate the monthly mortgage payment
let monthlyPayment = calculateMortgage(loanSum, interestRate, loanPeriod);

// I output the result to the console
console.log("Your Loan Amount is: EUR" + loanSum);
console.log("Your Annual Interest Rate is: " + interestRate + "%");
console.log("Your Loan Time is: " + loanPeriod + " years");
console.log("Your Monthly Mortgage Payment is: EUR" + monthlyPayment.toFixed(2)); // formatted to 2 decimal points for correctness
