    let monthlyPayment = (loanAmount * monthlyInterestRate * Math.pow(1 + monthlyInterestRate, numberOfPayments)) /
                         (Math.pow(1 + monthlyInterestRate, numberOfPayments) - 1);

    return monthlyPayment;  // Monthly payment is returned
}

// Below I will use random data for a loan amount, annual interest rate, and years

let loanAmount = 1000000;        // (EUR)
let annualInterestRate = 5;     //  (%)
let years = 30;                // (years)

// I calculate the monthly mortgage payment
let monthlyPayment = calculateMortgage(loanAmount, annualInterestRate, years);

// I output the result to the console
console.log("Loan Amount: EUR" + loanAmount);
